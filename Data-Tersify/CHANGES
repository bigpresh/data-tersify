    [Tweaks]
    
        Summary objects include the refaddr of the object they're summarising
        in hexadecimal, rather than decimal, because that's the format you
        expect that number to be in.

    [Features]

        Tersifies objects that it doesn't recognise, but which contain objects
        that it does. This was the point of writing this module, and something
        that it took me an embarrassing amount of time to get around to doing.

        Very simple Data::Tersify::perldb module for tweaking the debugger to
        automatically tersify.
